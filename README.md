# üìå Negative Predictive Value (NPV) in Clinical AI Evaluation

## üß† About the Project

This repository includes a visual and conceptual explanation of how **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** can remain high even when overall **accuracy** is low ‚Äî a scenario that still holds strong clinical value in real-world healthcare applications.

The visualization was prepared in **Excel**, and focuses on binary classification confusion matrix relationships between:
- Actual Class (True Label)
- Predicted Class (Model Output)

## üéØ Why This Matters

In most AI and machine learning projects, evaluation metrics like **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **accuracy** are often prioritized.

However, in **clinical applications**, the priorities shift.

One often overlooked yet **clinically critical** metric is **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**:

> üîé **NPV** indicates the likelihood that a person with a negative test result is truly disease-free.  
> It becomes especially important in **screening scenarios** ‚Äî where the aim is to confidently identify individuals without the disease.

This metric ensures that when a model says *"you are healthy,"* it is almost always correct ‚Äî a key requirement in healthcare.

## üìä What the Table Shows

The table visualized in this project represents a 2x2 confusion matrix:

|                 | **Predicted Positive** | **Predicted Negative** |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP)       | False Negative (FN) - Type II Error |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP) - Type I Error | True Negative (TN)       |

Below are the related metric formulas using confusion matrix terms:

| **Metric**     | **Formula**                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sensitivity    | TP / (TP + FN)                       |
| Specificity    | TN / (TN + FP)                       |
| Accuracy       | (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)      |
| Precision      | TP / (TP + FP)                       |
| NPV            | TN / (TN + FN)                       |

## üí¨ Reflections from Real-World Data

During my thesis work using real clinical datasets, I learned an important lesson:

> Even if the model‚Äôs **accuracy is modest**, a **high NPV** can make it **clinically valuable**.

In clinical practice, it‚Äôs common to hear:
> **‚ÄúLow accuracy may be acceptable if NPV is high.‚Äù**

This underscores the fact that:
- **Evaluation metrics should always be context-dependent.**
- **Reducing false negatives is crucial in early disease detection.**

This approach prioritizes not just statistical correctness but **human lives** behind the predictions.
